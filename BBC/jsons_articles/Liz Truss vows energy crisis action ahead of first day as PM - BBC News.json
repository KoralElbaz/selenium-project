boris johnson was the very definition of a primary colours, performance prime minister. but liz truss inherits the same challenges he was confronted by. governing when millions are confronted by unpayable bills. governing during a war in europe and in the aftermath of a pandemic. and governing a party that's already been in power for 12 years. read more from chris ms truss beat rival rishi sunak with 57% of the vote, a narrower win than expected. those expected to be appointed to her top team include kwasi kwarteng as chancellor, former leadership rival suella braverman as home secretary and james cleverly as foreign secretary. following ms truss's victory, the home secretary priti patel and culture secretary nadine dorries said they would be stepping down as senior ministers. mr johnson congratulated ms truss on her victory and said she had the right plan to \"unite our party\". ms truss paid tribute to her \"friend\" mr johnson in her victory speech, adding he would be \"admired from kyiv to carlisle\" for his record in office. \"boris, you got brexit done, you crushed jeremy corbyn, you rolled out the vaccine and you stood up to vladimir putin,\" she said. in a break with tradition, the outgoing and incoming prime ministers are expected to travel to balmoral castle in scotland for the handover of power, rather than buckingham palace. the queen has been suffering from mobility issues and it is understood the change was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements. ms truss has promised \u00a330bn in tax cuts in an emergency budget later this month, having blamed the tax burden for the uk's sluggish growth. her proposed cuts include reversing the rise in national insurance under mr johnson's tenure, temporarily ditching green levies on energy bills, and scrapping a planned rise to corporation tax. as well as the domestic agenda, her in-tray also includes continuing to support ukraine after its invasion by russia and repairing a fractious relationship with the eu over northern ireland. former chancellor rishi sunak, who attacked her economic plans during the campaign, told the bbc he would offer her his \"full support\". he said he will stand again to be an mp at the next general election, but is not expected to be in ms truss's cabinet. labour has called on ms truss to expand the windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to part-fund a six month freeze to domestic prices. the party followed the liberal democrats earlier this summer in backing a freeze, along with the snp. ms truss, however, has ruled out further windfall taxes, saying during the campaign it \"sends the wrong message to international investors\". speaking earlier, labour leader sir keir starmer pledged to work with ms truss to deliver a freeze, saying there was cross-party agreement on the idea. he criticised her approach on the economy, arguing she had talked more in her campaign about cutting taxes for businesses than the cost of living crisis. \"that shows that not only is she out of touch, but that she's not on the side of working people,\" he added. lib dem leader sir ed davey told bbc news ms truss \"appears to have no plan whatsoever\" to deal with rising prices, and the tories were responsible for \"lamentable\" economic growth. snp leader and scottish first minister nicola sturgeon called for the price freeze to include businesses, which are not normally covered by the uk's energy price cap, and extra cash support. \u00a9 2022 bbc. the bbc is not responsible for the content of external sites. read about our approach to external linking.
