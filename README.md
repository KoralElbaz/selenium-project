# Selenium project

This project allowed me to learn and experiment with Selenium. 

I conducted research on two websites: BBC and the BBG flight schedule.

On the BBC website, my task was to extract articles, store raw data, and perform word or phrase searches within the articles.

In the second part, I gathered real-time flight data from the flight schedule.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience and expanded my knowledge of web scraping using Selenium.
